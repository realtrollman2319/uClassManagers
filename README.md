# What does it contain?
More classes introduced<br/>
Extra methods for existing classes<br/>
Unturned's `static` managers (VehicleManager, ItemManager, etc.)<br/>

# Why are there no events?
I've decided to not add events on the module because sometimes, it can be laggy if I did so.
I'll add it on a seperate module, but that's going to be for another time.
For the meantime, use [uScriptExtended](https://github.com/MolyiEZ/uScriptExtended) for now.

# Note
Documentation soon, I REALLY promise.
Also DM me for any bugs that appear.<br/>

# Extra info
I've worked on this because the stock uScript methods are not enough and I want to implement some common methods in `SDG.Unturned`, so uScript can be usable enough.<br/>
Many people wonder "Where is x? You should add x." The answer is above.<br/>
I'm free to add suggestions here, if you want something to be added here, make an issue with the tag Suggestion.<br/>

# P.S
I'm not the developer of uScript2, it's @strlng.<br/>
I can't add syntax, or add more C# syntax (like LINQ) into uScript2.<br/>
<br/>
Incompatible modules:<br/>

<br/>
If you have one of these, remove it. If you don't, uScript will refuse to load, and you'll be greeted with `Duplicate definition of x`.
You can still use it, just without this module.<br/>
